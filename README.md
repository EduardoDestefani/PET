# **PET.py** project

Repository related to the `PET.py` projected, which aims to solve physics problems in python, as an example, directed to undergrad students of brazilian universities. All notebook were written in portuguese in order to facilitate the access for evreyone. 

The `PET.py` was idealized in 2020 by members of the Program of Tutorial Education in physics, an institution of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN, Brazil. 

One could check all notebooks from this project at the [PET website](https://petfisica.home.blog/pet-py/), which I really recommend if you liked what you saw here.
